# CO2-Emissions-Project

We experiment with various regression models in an effort to find the best precise prediction of a new automobile model's CO2 emissions. The regression models that we test are as follows:-

• Single Variable Linear Regression - First, we create an ML model with just 1 independent variable—Engine Size—and work to find the line that best fits the data to calculate CO2 emissions.


• Multiple Variable Linear Regression - Next, we design an ML model to calculate the CO2 emissions using all the parameters that linearly affect CO2 emissions, including engine size, cylinder count, and fuel consumption.

On the Jupyter notebooks, analysis is carried out using the Python Scikit-learn module. Using residual MSE, mean absolute error, the accuracy of each model is evaluated.
